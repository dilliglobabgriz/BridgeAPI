# Bridge API
## How to use

Currently in progress, to run tests use Maven with the command ```mvn test```

## Background

Full stack web application using Java's SpringBoot framework. Allows users to play and enjoy the game of bridge.

## Requirements

Requirements can all be found in the pom.xml but I am running this using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.4.3

## Dev TODO

1. Update Hand or CardHolder... probably hand to order cards "correctly"
2. Bidding system object, bidding implementation
3. Card playing, trick taking, winner of trick determiner
4. Frontend UI
